based on my old codes, when I was a Ph.D student). It is preserved as a
personal memorandum.

	I can get not so bad aicPortion below:
	(1) return(ts.union(nttLogDiffTs, topixLogDiffTs))
	in stockWeeklyRetrun.R
	 - ii = 1                 # i th time series
	 - kk = 1                 # the number of time series
	 - pp = 2~4                # AR order

	(2) return(ts.union(sonyLogDiffTs, topixLogDiffTs))
	in stockWeeklyRetrun.R
	 - ii = 1                 # i th time series
	 - kk = 1                 # the number of time series
	 - pp = 4~6                # AR order
